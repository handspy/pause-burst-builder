# Pause-Burst Builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/handspy/pause-burst-builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/handspy/pause-burst-builder)

A Java library to conduct the pause-burst analysis on handwriting captured data
and build its result. 

Pause-burst analysis is the core feature that originated [HandSpy (first version)](http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1820-0214/2013/1820-02141300061M.pdf).
After many years, this is still the main feature of HandSpy, after its complete reimplementation.
